# Instapaper/Pocket WebArchive Downloader

Downloads files stored in Instapaper or Pocket into the webarchive format

## Instapaper Use

- Download list of the URLs
- It would not delete successfully downloaded URLs - you have to do it yourself

## Pocket Use

- This one would require you to create access_token, as described (here)[http://getpocket.com/developer/docs/authentication]
- Planning at some future point
- Once that is done, you must replace Instaper/Pocket API in the code

## Dependencies

- https://github.com/newzealandpaul/webarchiver/
- See file requirements.txt in this distribution for python dependencies

## TODO

- Add authorization for Pocket access token
